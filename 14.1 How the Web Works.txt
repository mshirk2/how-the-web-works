1. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It defines the standards of communication and formatting used by the World Wide Web.

2. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It’s a web address used to locate a web page.

3. DNS stands for Domain Name System. It’s a reference of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

4. A query string is an element of a URL, and adds specificity to the address being called. It may directly load specific content in the URL path, or it may store the values of an HTML form submission.

5. GET retrieves data and content for a web page. POST sends data to be uploaded to the webpage.

6. This is made from a computer to a server. It’s a request for content/data.

7. A response from a server to the computer that placed a request. It could be the content requested, and/or status information and response code (404, 200, etc)

8. HTTP header is additional information sent along with the request/response. It could includes things like authentication, cache information, date/time, language, etc.

9. The browser checks to see if it has the corresponding IP address or content stored in the cache. If not, it sends a request up the hierarchy of the DNS until it finds the IP address for the URL. Then it sends a GET request to that IP to retrieve the data/content of the webpage, loads it, and stores it in the cache.
